# Tools and Tips to create Landing Pages that Convert
 
 #### The money you put into paid advertising is useless if you’re sending great traffic to bad landing pages.
 
There are several Plugins to build Landing pages on WP. I have used the 3 plugins in this Repo to build landing pages for my clients. While SeedProd and thrive are specifically for building Landing pages. Elementor is more general purpose.     
<br>
Landing page design consists of the elements, both visual and written, that make up a web page optimized to convert new customers and encourage repeat purchases. Simplicity in visual layout, benefit-driven copy, and high-quality product images are three of many guiding pillars for compelling landing page design. 



##   Build landing pages around your audience’s needs.


###   Analyze traffic and device source:  <br>
Google Analytics is a great partner to help you uncover where your traffic comes from and learn the kind of device your browsers most like to shop on. <br>
If your shoppers prefer desktops. Build a landing page that enhances the desktop experience.


###  Best practices also fail without context: <br>
Don’t get blinded by the latest design trends. Instead, make sure you get all the basics in place and do in-depth user research so you are making informed decisions that impact behavior, rather than simply tweaking page layouts. 


###  The flow of information across the entire landing page: <br>
Including the important stuff at the top. <br>
 majority of site visitors won’t scroll down
information hierarchy is very important.

### Tips:

1. Optimize your buy box for conversion.  <br>
2. Add customer testimonials and a review section.  <br>
3. Take great product photos.    <br>






4. Expand on your product descriptions.  <br>
5. Include certifications and unique selling propositions.   <br>
6. Upsell/cross-sell section.   <br>
7. Brag bar and a why section.   <br>
8. Use your landing pages to create a narrative.   <br>
